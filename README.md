Project 'Kipat Barzel' is a personal project I completed during JavaScript lessons, through which I implemented the material learned.

I drew the idea from the spirit of the times and the war that broke out during my studies.

The code was written in pure JavaScript.
The code can be run using a computer or laptop.

The goal of the game is to successfully intercept as many missiles as possible using the Iron Dome system.

You can use the Enter or Space key to launch an interception.

A successful interception adds money to your treasury, while wasting an interception or a rocket falling without interception reduces money from the treasury.
If the money runs out or if the interceptor itself is hit by a missile, the game is over.
Success in interception will lead to level advancement and an increase in missile frequency.

You can move the interceptor using the right and left arrows, and change its angle using the up and down arrows.
